## Theory
Learning is a little like doing a jigsaw puzzle. Normally when learning you are given a handful pieces and then required to go create your own. But how can you create your own or even work out how the handful you are given fit together?

Of course when you are teaching yourself, you are quite often given pieces for other puzzles while also getting parts of a single piece. It can be hard to know what part goes to what and which pieces are not even to your own puzzle.

In programming atleast, the puzzle itself could change on a daily basis. So not only do you need to find parts of the puzzle. It is also necessary to ensure that they are part of the same puzzle you are doing.

While it is not possible to be given all the pieces of the puzzle when you are starting out at programming. You can atleast be given a good number of them. More likely than not, you will ignore most of them.

Just knowing programming topics themselves is not enough. It is necessary to have the pieces to where they fit in. For example native programming and inline assembly. The book for example may not cover assembly, but it should atleast cover the basics of what assembly is via inline assembly.

For this book atleast, the concepts and ideas as well as some basics around them are covered. Keeping in mind that concepts and ideas themselves have a varying level of difficulty to learn. The methods for learning anything is well studied. Classically the research in the methods for learning have been directed at the topics at hand and not the concept and ideas themselves. Not all educators go the classical route with teaching methods. For these educators they focus on the concept and ideas. Unfortunately a lot of resources are not available for such teaching methods. Usually any resources easily available focus upon the topics at hand instead of teaching what does it actually mean in the big picture.

This is where the author would like the reader to take note. This book is directed at teaching concepts and ideas by using the D programming language as the first language for students. The choice in the language may seem strange since it is not typeically considered a main stream language. Because of its strengths it was chosen.
For them to succeed at programming a learner must be capable of:

- Learning by themselves
- Know when to ask for help
- How to phrase questions when asking for help
- To do the work in learning

It is said that it takes 10,000 hours of doing something while learning to get good at it. The author is taking this approach heavily within this book.
To archive this the author is pushing the reader into doing small exercises to show the purpose and to give a general overview of each topic to the reader. The theory accompanying it as well as the quizes are not required to be read and done. They are there so the reader once needing more information has a good source to expand upon.

A common layout for each topic is being used where programming discussion and learning content is. The layout of each topic is meant to engage the reader into the topic itself and not topics content. Where *optional* elements may not be required for every topic. They could be left out. The layout is as follows:

- Topic title
- Summary of topic
- Small exercise based upon the summary
- *Optional:* Break down of theory
- Actual theory
- *Optional:* Linking previous theory to current
- *Optional:* Quizzes
- *Optional:* Things to think about (or try out)

Further topics will have an application section to test the learners knowledge from all previous topics. Aimed at pushing the understanding of the recent ones.

This format was chosen to have as much optional content as possible for the first go at it. When learning it is not ideal to learn a whole new topic in one go. Instead it is done in iterations, slowly chipping away at what is not known.

Grouping the summary of the topic and the small exercise are to give the learner the "oh yay, I got it working!" moment up front. Without going too in depth in the theory.
For the breaking down of the theory, actual theory and quizes; are designed to get the learner to really understand the theoretical content.
Unlike the previous grouping of parts, the last part (things to think about) are to help the learner transition to the next topics.
