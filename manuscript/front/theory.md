## Theory
Learning any new concepts and ideas is a difficult task for anyone. Concepts and ideas them selves have a varying level of difficulty to learn. The methods for learning anything is well studied. Classically the research in the methods for learning have been directed at the topics at hand and not the concept and ideas them selves. Not all educators go the classical route with teaching methods. For these educators they focus on the concept and ideas. Unfortunately a lot of resources are not available for such teaching methods. Usually any resources easily available focus upon the topics at hand instead of teaching what does it actually mean in the big picture.
This is where the author would like the reader to take note. This book is directed at teaching concepts and ideas by using the D programming language as the first language for students. The choice in the language may seem strange since it is not typeically considered a main stream language. Because of its strengths it was chosen.
For them to succeed at programming a learner must be capable of:

- Learning by themselves
- Know when to ask for help
- How to phrase questions when asking for help
- To do the work in learning

It is said that it takes 10,000 hours of doing something while learning to get good at it. The author is taking this approach heavily within this book.

Topics in this book will take the format of:

- Topic title
- Summary of topic
- Small exercise based upon the summary
- *Optional:* Break down of theory
- Actual theory
- *Optional:* Linking previous theory to current
- *Optional:* Quizes
- *Optional:* Things to think about (or try out)

Grouping the summary of the topic and the small exercise are to give the learner the "oh yay, I got it working!" moment up front. Without going too in depth in the theory.
For the breaking down of the theory, actual theory and quizes; are designed to get the learner to really understand the raw theoretical content.
Unlike the previous grouping of parts, the last part (things to think about) are to help the learner transition to the next topics.
