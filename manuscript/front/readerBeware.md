# Road map

As it turns out writing a book is hard. This book like others of the authors goes through iterations. Of course to make this effective requires reader feedback for improvements!

As of 17/06/2015 the book has completed the first iteration. At third iteration it will be going into print. This is expected to be commenced at the start of 2016.

The second iteration will introduce design patterns and more exercises. The first iteration introduces most topics as well as the book structure.
