## General learning technqiues
There are many different styles of learning[^LearningStyles]. If you haven't already worked out what style works best for you. You should do that.

* Visual

  You may find that tables and drawing will help you understand what code is doing.
* Aural

   Listen to music more while learning or writing code.
* Verbal

   Write code and don't forget commenting it a lot! Although writing comments is always a good thing.
* Physical

  Unfortunately programming is not a very physical activity. Perhaps you could use some really cool piece of technology to make that a reality?
* Logical

   Programming is a very logical task. Because of this you will find it resonably easy. When you ignore that it is also an art form.
* Social

   Get on IRC! Seriouly come on. Learn and chat with others. Might be a good idea to get a few friends involved and bounce ideas off them!
* Solitary 

   Most programmers love solitary environments. It helps us think better about a task. Use this to your advantage.

Most of the comments listed for each learning type, will apply to pretty much everyone. Try out different techniques and remember being social will help you.

T> **Tip!** Don't memorise
T> Seriously don't. The best programmers learn ideas and concepts. Most other information can be looked up and applied immediately.
