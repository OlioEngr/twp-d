## Being part of an online community
As a programmer you will be quite often interacting with communities over the internet. Not just within a company that you may be working at.
These communities will almost always be full of programmers. And not of designers or business people. They will be focused upon the communities projects, weather this is a programming language or an ecosystem for cloud delivery of applications.

Some general rules you should live by while in an online community:

* Listen to what others have to say
* When others say something that you disagree with, do not say mean things to them. What is defined as mean is determined by the community
* When you make a mistake own up to it. Do not get aggressive or concerned about it. Everybody makes mistakes. How we handle it once we know about it is what counts
* They have rules, they might not be written but they exist. Try and learn them before rushing into the community and trying to change things
* If you are part of a company, you are a representative of them. Act the way your colleagues would expect of you

The most important thing to remember is to respect others. As long as you respect them and do what they expect you to do as a member of their community you will be accepted. If they do not act respectfully towards you it is a good sign that you should not be interacting with them.

In terms of this book when you want or need help there will be a few ways to get it. Primarily the D.learn newsgroup (forum)[^DLearnNewsGroup]. To post on the forum, you are not required to register.

We will also be using the IRC network Open and Free Technology Community (OFTC)[^OFTCsite]. Is an IRC network dedicated towards software development. Specifically for open source projects. There is a tutorial under the IRC section on how to connect.
