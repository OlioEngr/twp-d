# Getting started
To write any code in the D programming language, you require a tool chain. Don't worry this is free and easy to get working.

The basic steps:

1. Choose the compiler you want to be installed (in your case dmd)
2. Download the installation media for that tool chain[^DDownloads]
3. Run the installer (if chosen otherwise unpack the zip)
4. Optionally add dmd to PATH (if you used an installer this was probably done for you)

It is also prudent to know how to get help during learning. For this how to be part of online communities is important to know.
