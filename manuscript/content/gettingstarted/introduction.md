# Getting started
To write any code in the D programming language, you require a toolchain. Don't worry this is free and easy to get working.

The basic steps:
1. Choose the compiler you want to be installed (in your case dmd)
2. Download the installation media for that toolchain[^DDownloads]
3. Run the installer (if chosen otherwise unpack the zip)
4. Optionally add dmd to PATH (if you used an installer this was probably done for you)
