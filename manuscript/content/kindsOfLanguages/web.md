## Web
**Summary:**

Languages used in web development are of two forms. The first being used directly in the browser and second running on a server.

**Theory:**

There are two kinds of languages used in web development. Front end is ran in the browser and allows communication to the backend while modifying the display of the content. The backend on the other hand serves content to the user. In a form called web services. The user could not be a website but instead an application.

The two different kinds of web development langauges have in recent years converged more and more. At this point the language being ran in the browser Javascript (EcmaScript 4) is also being used for backend development (node.js). Of note is that EcmaScript is a scripting language and was poorly designed as it was never designed to do what it currently is doing.

Backend languages focus upon serving content to the user. Quite often this will include a database and perhaps a file serving system such as a Content Distribution Network (CDN).
It may also include other external services such as printing or even a webcam.

Frontend languages unlike backend languages get transcompiled into EcmaScript 4. Most likely occuring ahead of time using a compiler. This could be automated as per the backend system or done by the developer manually.

Of note is that in some systems whole websites must be packaged up before being served.
