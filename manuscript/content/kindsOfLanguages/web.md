## Web
**Summary:**

Languages used in web development are of two forms. The first being used directly in the browser and second running on a server.

**Theory:**

There are two kinds of languages used in web development. Front end is ran in the browser and allows communication to the back end while modifying the display of the content. The back end on the other hand serves content to the user. In a form called web services. The user could not be a website but instead an application.

The two different kinds of web development languages have in recent years converged more and more. At this point the language being ran in the browser JavaScript (ECMAScript 4) is also being used for back end development (node.js). Of note is that ECMAScript is a scripting language and was poorly designed as it was never designed to do what it currently is doing.

Back end languages focus upon serving content to the user. Quite often this will include a database and perhaps a file serving system such as a Content Distribution Network (CDN).
It may also include other external services such as printing or even a web cam.

Front end languages unlike back end languages get trans compiled into ECMAScript 4. Most likely occurring ahead of time using a compiler. This could be automated as per the back end system or done by the developer manually.

Of note is that in some systems whole websites must be packaged up before being served.
