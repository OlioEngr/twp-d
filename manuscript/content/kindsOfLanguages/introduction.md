# Kinds of languages
**Sumary:**

There are many different kinds of languages out there. There are specificalist ones in almost every domain and there are many many more then what is ever taught or used in the real world.

**Theory:**

Each kind of language (not the family but purpose) have a specific purpose in its own domain. Generally speaking they will not have a statement to introduce it as being *must be able to do x*. Instead the goal will be along the lines of *must be able to conform in this domain with these concerns*.

On the other hand, languages are devided into families. Where C is the most common. There are other ones that have a rich history such as LISP or more recently Python-isque. This is generally not a formal decision but instead an implicit decision when it is first being made on how it should look and feel. The previous language history of the designers heavily impact upon it.

The language family determines the syntax unlike the kind of language which focusses about how it is executed and used. Most likely also includes the libraries that are built for it.

The kinds of language that exist are:

* Native (e.g. microcontrollers or x86 cpu's), compiles to assembly. Most likely allow to interact with the execution unit directly (inline assembly).
* Web
	* Frontend (runs in the web browser)
	* Backend (runs on a server)
* Scripting, extends another program to add new functionality at runtime.
* Shells, a form of scripting that enables control and interaction to the computer by the user.
* Enterprise, these languages focus heavily on tooling and writing good solid code.

**Previous theory:**

So far D has been used to teach programming. It has been said that D is a C style/family language. It is also classified as a native language capable of web development (specifically backend development). Unlike most languages it also capable of being a scripting language for external programs.
This makes it a major outlier compared to other languages that generally only full into one maybe two categories.
