### Shells

**Summary:**

Shells are a very specific kind of scripting language. It is used primarily by the user to interact with the system.

**Theory**:

Shell languages such as Bash and Batch have a primary purpose to allowing the user to interact with the system in a very advanced way. However unlike GUI's Shells must be learned. Not only this the programs available to the user must be understood and remembered. Otherwise most actions would be hard to do, let alone work out.

Performance in shell languages are not a big concern. Because they are usually simple commands that rely on others to do the actual hard work.
