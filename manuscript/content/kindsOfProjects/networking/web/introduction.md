## Web development
**Summary:**

Web development is split into two factions. Client side and server side. There are many libraries that aid each side.

**Theory:**

Unless you want to only store information on a users computer, during web development you will need server side and client side.

Server side, is the act of running a program on a server to process requests from clients and return them. During this process a database server may be accessed or even other servers.

Client side, is the act of making a web browser do something. This is seperated out into two kinds of libraries. Javascript and CSS. CSS libraries are more though of as frameworks however. Javascript in of itself is a fully functioning language so it can have many different kinds of libraries with it.
