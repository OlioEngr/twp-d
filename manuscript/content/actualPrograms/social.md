## Social constraints
**Summary:**

How a project is developed, deployed and accepted is a crucial part of a project. The project can succeed in its requirements but if it does not meet what the users need or want, it has failed.

**Theory:**

During a project, it will have many people interact with it. From developers to users. A general list is:

* Owners
* Stakeholders
* Users
* Developers
* Designers
* Business analyst
* Testers
* System admins
* Managers
* Educators

The above list is fairly explicit and more inline with larger projects then smaller ones.
For smaller projects it usually more developer and owner focused.

The term stakeholder is a fairly abstract term. It's meaning simply means a person who has an invested interest in the project success. Such as a patient at a hospital.

Another fairly abstract term is managers. Managers can be everything from human resource employees to the 'project owner'. In essence it is a person who ensures the success of the project by keeping others on track and working to appropriate deadlines.

System admins may seem an odd one on the given list. They are responsible for the roll out of the given system to the respective machines.

The last not so obvious group of people is the educators. Educators train the users in how to use the new system. This may be in coordination with the marketing department. Should the end users not be local to the company.

A very important topic that must be discussed is user acceptance of the project. User acceptance is where users accept the project and want to use it, instead of the previous system (if any).
This is usually handled by the educators and business analysts. However its is fairly common for owners to override the needs of the users I'm place of their own wants.

The very act of getting users to accept a project is a widely experimented one. With many articles about it. There is no one way to do it. As the diversity of the users increases becomes an increased chance of failure towards them.

A large part of user acceptance is understanding them. So it is not uncommon to hear body language being used to understand their behaviour.
