## Code methodologies
**Summary:**

Unlike project methodologies which deals with how the project is done, code methodologies is how the implementation is made.

**Theory:**

Generally speaking there are a few methodologies used while implementing a project. Some of the more benign and less methodology heavy ones are review before commit and peer programming. There are more formal ones such as Test Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).

Test Drive Development and Behaviour Driven Development heavily rely upon the ecosystem that is implementing the project to add reassurance that the system is complete and without bugs.

TDD uses unittesting libraries to ensure the completeness of the implementation to the expected usage of it.
Where as for BDD, the usage of libraries to explain the expected behaviour of the code (the input/output and how it does it). Unlike TDD, BDD can help to automate the creation process for the codebase. It can also act as a testing mechanism like unittesting.

Unlike project methodologies, code methodologies are a fairly young area of study and have really only came about since Agile methologies became popular.
