## Standardisation
**Summary:**

Making programs compatible outside of the control of a company requires standards. Standards along with compliance auditing is a paper work heavy topic.

**Theory:**

To combat propriety protocols and file formats are standards. Standards describe how to interact with and the actual process exists for a specific item. Protocols such as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), TCP and IRC are well standardised. Most commonly they have scopes of what they support.

The standards themselves are not the main concept to be understood in this topic. It's there usage within a project. Along with standards are standardised testing. Standard testing ensures compliance that it works as advertised.

Protocols and file formats are not the only standard types that exist. There are other kinds such as project methodologies that are made compliant by "qualified" people instead making the project compliant with it.
