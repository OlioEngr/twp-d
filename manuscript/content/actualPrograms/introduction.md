# Working in real world projects, what can go wrong?
**Summary:**

The topic of what really happens within real world projects is a rather twisty and scary one. It is never as straight forward of a process when you are working with others and any worth while project will include other people.
To further complicate this relationship of stakeholders, developers and managers. Is concepts such as resource constraits along with the boundry pushing activities for the requirements of the project.

**Theory:**

The topic of how to develop software successfully is a rather large and extensive one. With everyone along with their dog having an opinion on it. With simplistic answers starting at, just use the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) or Scrum. Those are project methodologies.

Project methodologies are the process to which the project actuates. These can be used when working alone or in a team. Of course not all project methodologies are created equal. In some scenarios a methodology such as Scrum or Interative and Icremental is more apropriete the the SDLC. Which are classified as Agile methodologies. They defining feature of agile methodologies is the concept that you can never do things in go. Instead do them in a little bits fast to turn out as many features as possible.

There are many other methods to try and make software development projects successful others including Test Driven Development (TDD), otherwise known as write tests for code, then the rest of the code base later.

Most of the theory associated with project methodologies is not listed here, nor the plusses and minuses of each indevedual technique. This is because it is too vast of a knowledge base to do so. Many many books are dedicated to even a single one.
