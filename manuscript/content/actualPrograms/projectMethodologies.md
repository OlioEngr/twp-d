## Project Methodologies
**Summary:**

Project management methodologies are the process to which projects are developed in. The ones used for software development are not necessarily unique to the IT industry.

**Theory:**

Project management is a very interesting field of study. Team leaders dedicated to studying these subjects along with many other implied ones.
It is constantly changing and in a lot of ways very hyped field. A great example is the usage of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) especially in previous years (1980's-2010) when it was never recommended. At the current time (2015) Agile based methodologies are the hyped and preffered methodologies being used by the industry. Unlike the SDLC and similar methodologies Agile based ones have been shown that in a lot of cases they are far more successful.

The SDLC may be a failure in a lot cases, but it is well used and loved within the industry. For this reason alone it is a rather prudent decision to study it.

The SDLC follows the very basic process of:

* Initiation
* Requirements
	* Gathering
	* Analysis
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Roll out
* Retirement

The above list is a more general concept of how it works. A more techniqual and exempler description is as follows:

Most projects tend to not fully complete this life cycle. This is because projects using this methodology have trouble managing change and because of this fail.

Change management is the process to manage change requests by stakeholders for its requirements and design during implementation in most cases.

Agile methodologies are project methodologies that focus heavily on quickly completing features while minimizing lock in. This allows getting the product shipping faster and changing as the stakeholders need.

A simplistic Agile methodology is Iterative and Incremental. Iterative and Incremental is essentially the SDLC except a very high focus on implementing the project in steps and not on the documentation.
Because of it being iterative, the risk of doing things wrong the first time does not exist as such.

A more common Agile methodology is Scrum. Within the Scrum community are Scrum masters, who taking courses to up skill themselves in able to perform it. Their job is to coordinate and manage a team using it.

The above theory is by far not complete. There is many good books, aritcles and research papers on these topics. As well as reports and reviews about projects using them. Review these topics if you wish to further broaden your knowledge in them.
