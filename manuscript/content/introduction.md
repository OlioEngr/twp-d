# Introduction
Getting started on how to program is a difficult task. Do not be afraid. There is a lot of hard work involved, but this book is written to help make this journey relatively easy. The general flow of this book is as follows:

1. Before diving in and writing code, tools are required. Specifically a compiler toolchain. After a simple test script to ensure it is working for you, an informative introduction to profesionalism and online communities.

2. Grouping of code "functions" is introduced. This forms the very basics of how code is executed.
3. Variables, the way information is stored and how to manipulate them.
4. Your environment. Discusses the command line and the environment around them. This introduces basic interfaces to communicating with the user as well a bit about how operating systems actually work.
5. Associative arrays and arrays. How to store large amount of information in memory. In one variable.
6. Referencing memory. Information stored in RAM can be referenced and directly used. This is called a pointer. But what does that really mean?
7. Structs and unions. Grouping of information in memory to allow for more complex data hierachies.
8. More advanced form of grouping of information in memory using classes. Otherwise known as Object Orientated Programming (OOP).
9. A general overview of assembly. How does things really get represented in memory?
10. Function and delegate pointers. How to pass around functions, to other functions!
11. Operator overloads, making those special statements and expressions do all sort of neat stuff for our own types.
12. Meta programming and attributes. How can I make it do something special based upon some input information?
13. Different kinds of programming languages and their uses.
14. Designing large programs, what can possibly go wrong?
TODO: adds e.g. design patterns
15. What to do after this book?
