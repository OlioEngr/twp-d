# Introduction
Programming is an exciting subject, even more so when there are other people involved! For this reason, this book will introduce the reader into understanding their potential as a future programmer while keeping it social!

Don't fret if you don't have friends on this journey! Even if you are an introvert you will make some fairly easily. Join the social groups available to you which are listed under *getting started*. The community will help you when you get stuck on this journey, as we all started from the bottom like you are now. The only way to fail, is to not try at all while learning.

Before being able to write any code you need some tools under your belt! These tools are not too difficult to gain or use, unless of course you are running Windows 95! Most of what you need to do is download and install a few programs. Thats about it. There is also some information reguarding how to get help and how to act on those services. You will also need to test your tools (specifically the compiler which makes code runnable!) and don't worry this is not too intense!

Having a working toolchain is an excelllant first step in becomming a programmer. Without one, well the code is practically useless. So with one you can begin in understanding how to make a computer think like you do about data. But that doesn't tell the computer what is in that data. For that you need variables and types! But that doesn't help you if you only have some data understood by the computer in memory. Now on to how to manipulate it using statements and expressions.

Now that you have the ability to manipulate and act on data, you can apply it in a context. Thats right, programs are run with a context. They are given information and have the ability to perform input output based upon it! This will be your entry skill set to any language that you may face in the future.
In other words, the ability to execute, store, manipulate data and take input/output to the user.

So far data are represented with fairly simple types with the most complex being arrays. Which are really pretty simple in themselves too! Now lets move on to more complex types which essentially just group functions and data together. So in others grouping of some data to make a context for functions to act upon!

Structs and unions may seem simple and awesome, but lets look at making data extend other pieces of data and how to model that. By using Object Orientated Programming (OOP) and inheritance.

Now we can see how complex data types can be. Lets take a look into what code really is shall we? Function and delegate pointers allow for executing code out of their original declarations. This style of programming is formally known as functional (although this is a very basic part of it).

Along with functions, code itself can be customized via arguments as well as conditionally compiled. This introduces to the pandoras box which is Compile Time Function Execution (CTFE) as well as meta-programming.

A more traditional language feature of OOP is the ability to modify its behaviour with other language features such as assignment. Operator overloading is a fairly simple feature but great to know!

Understanding where D sits in the compilation process is important to being able to work with it properly. So the basis of what the toolchain is actually doing is explained here.

Most language core concepts have been covered so far. Now its time to focus on the overall context that programming exists. Specifically the different kinds of programming languages that exist.

So far the basics of programming has been covered. But for the actual usage in a real world situation, must be covered. The interacting with people outside of the project itself as well user acceptance is covered here.

To make your code more understandable for others, idioms are introduced. The introduction gives a short introduction to a few different kinds as well as there purpose.

Along with idioms comes design patterns. Like idioms, design patterns are meant to help make your code more readable. But unlike idioms, design patterns are meant more for OOP and are more of a template on how your code must be arranged.

For future easement into what already exists, different kinds of libraries are discussed as well as there uses. Examples are used to give a good example of what is and isn't one.

Some languages use a set concept in how it is designed. Others use a mixture of concepts. These concepts are called paradigms. They determine what the code not only looks like, but also how it is thought of by the developer.

19. What to do after this book?
20. A list of exercises based upon the book's contents to learn from

T> ## Create, Compile and Delete often!
T> CCD or Create, Compile and Delete often is a technique used to learn programming.
T> By creating code often, running it then delete you get to try out new techniques and language fetures quickly.
T> In fact parts of this book was written by content generated by such scripts.

T> ## Sleep
T> Yes, sleep is good for programmers.
T> It may not seem like it, but when you have a problem that you cannot solve try  doing other things or even sleeping!
T> It allows the brain to continue working on the problem for a longer period without worrying or wearing you out too much.
