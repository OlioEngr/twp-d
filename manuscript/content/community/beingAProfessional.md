## Being a professional
A professional is much more then just a suit and tye. In fact as programmers that would be too formal for most occasions.

### Professional Institutes
There are institutes which hold their members to a high standard within the IT community. Their goal is to further IT in some form. Such as getting more females into IT or creating a better IT work force in general.
They have generally a code of conduct that does have consequences if not followed.
These institutes are meant for while you are learning at e.g. a University and while in the workforce. They commonly have events that can be attended for both free and payed. Hiring managers at larger companies can be quite impressed by membership. As it shows dedication, competency and skill as an IT worker.
Some education institutions and companies may have partnerships with such organization making all members of staff members of the professional institute.

A great example of a professional institute is IITP[^IITPwebsite]. Almost everything above is done by IITP. They partner with education institutes such as CPIT[^CPITwebsite] and run events for members. There is also a code of conduct[^IITPCodeOfConduct].
If you are learning by yourself, a profesional institute is probably not a good way to go at this point in time. Instead I would recommend foccussing on getting into some form of online community such as D's to learn from. If you are at an education institute post high school, and a bit further down in your studies then a profesional institute can help you get a job early on. Use the events as a way to network with others. Get to know your local workforce.

### General rules to live by
Some rules that any profesional should work based upon:

1. Just because everybody else does it, doesn't mean you should
    You should at the best possible actions at every point. If others do shady work, you should aim to not be part of it or even to stop it. Such actions are not profesional. By bettering yourself and your actions, everyone reaps the benefit. Just don't go over doing it.
2. Treat others with respect
    This should be pretty obvious, treat others with respect at all times. Even if you do not like them or if you happen to like them a little too much. Sexism and rasicm is against human rights and in quite a few countries illegal. In New Zealand there is the Human Rights Commission for these issues and they will enforce these rights.
3. Not all people think the same way
    In a world that is connected more so then ever before, expecting people from other cultures to behave like you do in your culture is offensive and ignorant. If in doubt ask. If you make a mistake apolagize.
4. Make mistakes
    Mistakes will happen. Own up to them. Learn from them. Apolagize if necessary. If you spend 1 million dollar inaproprietely, you have just had a 1 million dollar training opertunity. Remember you cause it, you fix it! If possible, it will not always be possible to fix your mistakes and thats ok.
A lot of these are based upon IITP's code of conduct[^IITPCodeOfConduct]. The author recommends that the reader reads it if they are interested in this topic.
5. If you say you are going to do something, do it
    Basically do what you say. Say when you can't. But never be on the fence about doing something and not say so. If you are unable to do it, again say so. It is probably not up to you wheather it is worth you learning it when in a company.
6. Keep learning
    I can't stress this one enough. Learn constantly. Have side projects. If your boss doesn't like it? Too bad! They need to understand that up skilling makes you a better programmer. In fact, it could one day benefit the company.
