## Forums
Web based forums are one of the most common web applications used in online communities. They are simple to setup and easy to for users to interact with. They commonly use a form of writing called bbcode's. BBcodes are a method to encode certain formatting instructions such as font size and images. These take very little space and require no set format for the entirety of the post. They can be mixed with other formats such as markdown.
BBcode came before markdown and was heavily used and still is today in forums.

Markdown is a popular format in both hosted version control systems (think Github and Bitbucket) and even for book writing environments.

When dealing with forums, take into consideration who runs it. If it is being ran so that a company can foster a products community, it would not be the best idea to discuss how to expose the internals of that product. But if it is to help teach programming than discussing and showing projects that you have done is a great idea to get feedback by both more experianced programmers and those who are just beguinning.

Forums like any social media platform, can create friendships between users. Even marriages. Some people may be open to it, others may not. Not everyone will want to be messaged and have conversations started. So think of it as if it happens it happens, trying to force it will only make moderators unhappy with you.


Commonly with posts a signature may be attached. Not all communities will appreciate a life story on every single one of your posts. So if you must do it, keep it short and related to the community. Signatures are just a message that the user wants appended to each post they make.

Some posts may be what is known as stickied. Stickied posts are posts that will always stay at the top of a forum board. This will be done by a moderator or an admin to help make the forum/board maintenace easier. So when first joining keep an eye on them, read the ones applicable to you so that you can follow the rules and fit in.

Not all posts should be commented to. When a post ages by a certain time, most communities will deem it 'wrong' to comment. Bringing back a thread from death essentially. This is known as necro posting. The age deemed as dead will be different per community. Some will enforce it such as Reddit by auto blocking such commenting.

At the end of the day, do what the moderators tell you to unless an admin/owner says otherwise.

If you do not follow the rules and guidelines by the community or just happen to really upset and admin/moderator you can be banned. Banning may have a time limit and allow you back in later on or not. It can come in the form of just your login/email or it could be in the form of an IP ban. Meaning anyone using the same internet connection as you will not be able to use their site. There are ways to get around these blockings and they are known as ban evading. Such actions are considered bad and will result in permanent exclusion.
