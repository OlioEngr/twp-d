## Forums
Web based forums are one of the most common web applications used in online communities. They are simple to setup and easy to for users to interact with. They commonly use a form of writing called bbcode's. BBcodes are a method to encode certain formatting instructions such as font size and images. These take very little space and require no set format for the entirety of the post. They can be mixed with other formats such as markdown.
BBcode came before markdown and was heavily used and still is today in forums.

Markdown is a popular format in both hosted version control systems (think Github and Bitbucket) and even for book writing environments.

When dealing with forums, take into consideration who runs it. If it is being ran so that a company can foster a products community, it would not be the best idea to discuss how to expose the internals of that product. But if it is to help teach programming than discussing and showing projects that you have done is a great idea to get feedback by both more experianced programmers and those who are just beguinning.

Forums like any social media platform, can create friendships between users. Even marriages. Some people may be open to it, others may not. Not everyone will want to be messaged and have conversations started. So think of it as if it happens it happens, trying to force it will only make moderators unhappy with you.

Commonly with posts a signature may be attached. Not all communities will appreciate a life story on every single one of your posts. So if you must do it, keep it short and related to the community. Signatures are just a message that the user wants appended to each post they make.
