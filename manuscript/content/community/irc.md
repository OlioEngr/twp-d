## Internet Relay Chat
Internet Relay Chat or IRC for short has been with the internet since the dawn of it. Originating from Bulletin Board systems back in the 80's. It features a light weight text based protocol. Enabling anyone to read and write it.

When working with it by hand, it is possible to communicate to an IRC server using only a telnet client successfully. Because of this there are IRC clients on everything from an Apple II to a Blackbury smart phone.

A group of IRC servers is called a network. The network can be split up randomly called a netsplit. These splits should repair themselves within a few minutes and are normal. Quite often a seperate program operating 'services' will connect as a server to the network.

Services are systems that provide user authentication and management of the IRC network in general. They are designed to aid all members of the network.

Operators or opers for short, are people who administrate the network in general. Any one of them can perform an IP ban or do anything to you upon the network as they wish.

There are two methods for communicating within an IRC network:

1. Private messages

   You will have one private message always to the server you are connected to. These will include messages such as the Message Of The Day (MOTD) or general information about the network upon connect.
2. Channels

   Channels are the main form of communication. It enables communicating with a group of people. Channels have a verity of 'levels'. A level determines what a user can do within that channel. The actual control of a channel is done by was is normally known as chanserv aka channel service.

Within a channel there is a title, list of users and that actual chat itself. The mechanism that powers the chat in a channel vs a private message is the same. Only a channel is prefixed by a #.
Common services that an IRC network will have are:

There are many services available on an IRC network. Some may have more then others. But the common ones are:

* Channel management
* Nickname management (users)
* Operator control
* Spam/Bot prevention
* Memos (messages to possibly offline users)
* Custom host name, provides a custom host name associated with your nickname instead of your IP address
* Bot services, custom nicknames and joined to your channel for the different services. More commonly just for channel management
