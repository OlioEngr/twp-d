## Mailing lists
Mailing lists come in two primary form. A single poster posting to a list of email addresses and a M:N[^ManyToManyMeaning]  relationship. They both use emails to send the mail to recipients. For programmers the most important one is the M:N one. The first one is used by both companies to give out information as well as spamers.

A Common name for mailing lists is a Newsgroup. They are similar in functionality but Newsgroups have some history behind them and have seperate interfaces mechanisms. But for all intents and purposes they are the same to a user.

Mailing lists have hierachical posting nature. Unlike forums. A forum comment, is commenting on the original post. But for mailing lists, you are commenting upon a specific comment.

Like forums they perform the same goals, but they do not implicitly have formatting and it is in fact discouraged. For public mailing lists, things like signatures can be not worth while. And to some communities not wanted. Keep in mind, once you post in a mailing list, its posted for good. Unlike forums there is no way to change what you posted, so think twice before you go insulting somebody.

Setting up your own mailing list is a difficult task. Some email providers such as Google will get very fussy. To them you might as well be spam. Once your IP is marked as a spamer, it can be hard to undo it.

The D community is a great example for using a Newsgroup. There are others such as GNU foundation. They are quite popular in the larger open source projects. But that is slowly changing.

[^ManyToManyMeaning]: M:N notation is a database design form to represent many to many.
