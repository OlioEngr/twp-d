# Exercises
Ensuring and testing knowledge is a hard thing to do. Commonly when learning either a new language or library it is customary to produce a test program. When learning to program you will be unable to understand what you should do. So some exercises are listed here to get started with.

Learn from them. Having them work is ok. Just try. Ask for help if you get stuck. Remember IRC on OFTC #twp-d if you need assistance. The author will be available there atleast once a day. Otherwise the D learn newsgroup will be more than happy to help.

There are some answers to these exercises at the back of the book. These are the authors creation and may not directly match up with the exercises completely.
