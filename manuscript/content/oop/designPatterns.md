## Design patterns
**Summary:**

Design patterns are a recognizable way to write code. In other words, your code will comply with a design pattern. So it is a little like a specification.

**Theory:**

A design pattern allows anyone to read your code and understand the general purpose of what you want the code to do. While it does not express the exact purpose, it does show how it is meant to do it. It also is useful for preventing bugs and code smells.
The actual theory as to why you should use them is described in another chapter later on in the book. Right now a general understand of what they are is important and how they different from actual specifications for code.

A program specification is all about external behaviour of the program. It is possible that it will define how it must do it e.g. use this library. The primary difference between internal and external behaviours is external is either user of other program interfaces.

Design patterns on the other hand specify how you write the code itself. They can range from just specifying the existence of a single class and what methods it must have, to numerous classes, free-functions, structs ext. With very specific requirements on fields/methods and there behaviours.
