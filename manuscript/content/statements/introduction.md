# Statements and flow
**Summary:**

Statements perform operations such as function calls and variable assignment. There is also a derivative that performs changes in code flow.

**Theory:**

Statements perform an operation. This will have one of three forms.

1. Assignment
2. Function call
3. Flow

Assignments will include a variable name and an equals sign before an expression.
Function calls, are pretty straight forward. Nothing special here.
Flow usually include curly braces ``{`` and ``}``.

Assignment statements have already been covered from variables and so have function calls. Flow on the other hand have not.

**Previous theory:**

Previously you have used function calls to execute the writeln function and perform variable assignment to save a value from the command line.
